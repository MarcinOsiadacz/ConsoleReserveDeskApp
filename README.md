# ConsoleReserveDeskApp

## About
Final project in the third semester of studies at the [Warsaw School of Computer Science](https://www.wwsi.edu.pl/).

Itâ€™s a console app that allows the user to reserve a desk. There are two types of desks: 
- a regular desk
- a hot desk

Regular disk is assigned to the single user until it is manually released. The hot desk can be reserved by many users, depending on the time selected. Reservation of hot desk cannot be less than one hour and more than seven days. 

Desk objects are grouped and managed by rooms, and they are grouped and managed by buildings.

Basic object-oriented programming paradigms were used, such as own classes, abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces.
